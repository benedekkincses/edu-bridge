# Concept of the project

## The project in a nutshell
A school–parent portal for two-way communication, with thematic groups, events, and reminders.
Everything that parents previously handled through Messenger, Facebook groups, separate Excel sheets, or envelopes is now available on a secure platform with school integration.

## The problem
There is currently no truly good solution for communication between schools and parents.
Many schools subscribe to Teams, and parents are required to register an account because of it. They try to manage parent–teacher meeting bookings through apps integrated into Teams — but Teams wasn’t designed for this purpose.
