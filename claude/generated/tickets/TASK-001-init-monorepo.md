# TASK-001: Initialize Monorepo Structure

**Type:** Task
**Epic:** EPIC-001
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** Backlog
**Assignee:** Unassigned

## Description
Create the initial monorepo structure using npm workspaces with proper directory organization for API, web, mobile, and shared packages.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create root package.json with workspaces configuration
- [ ] Create packages/api directory with package.json
- [ ] Create packages/web directory with package.json
- [ ] Create packages/mobile directory with package.json
- [ ] Create packages/shared directory with package.json
- [ ] Set up .gitignore for node_modules, dist, .env, logs
- [ ] Create docker/ directory for Docker configurations

## Acceptance Criteria
- All packages can be installed with single `npm install` command
- Each package has its own package.json with proper name and version
- Workspace dependencies are properly linked
- .gitignore prevents committing generated files

## Technical Notes
```json
// Root package.json
{
  "name": "edubridge",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "packages/*"
  ]
}
```

## Estimated Effort
2 hours
