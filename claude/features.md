# Features of the project
We aim to build a school–parent communication portal that addresses the shortcomings of existing solutions.
These are the core features we plan to implement.

## Key Features:
- News feed
- Group creation and management
- Inviting parents to groups
- Privacy settings: open, closed
- Two-way communication: messaging between parents and teachers — with thread support, @mentions, and a “Seen” feature
- AImee knowledge base chatbot — based on school regulations (e.g., when, how much, and where to pay — for lunch, excursions, opening ceremonies, parent meetings, tests...); with multi-language support (important in Europe)

## Nice to have:
- Group collaboration tools: polls, volunteer sign-up forms, task lists, event organizer
- Notification system — opt-in/opt-out, choice of channel: email, notification, SMS
- Event calendar
- Booked4US appointment booking integration for parent-teacher meeting scheduling
